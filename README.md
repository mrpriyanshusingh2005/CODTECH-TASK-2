OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT :-
The Weather Forecast App is a web-based application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city. The application fetches data from a weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface, including the city name, country, temperature, and local time. The app also includes an image representing the current weather condition to enhance the user experience.

Key Features
Real-Time Weather Data: The app fetches up-to-date weather data, including temperature, city, and country details, from a weather API.
Dynamic UI Updates: The interface updates dynamically based on the user's input and displays relevant weather information for the specified city.
Weather Icons: The app displays an icon representing the current weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy), making the information more visually appealing.
Responsive Design: The app is styled using CSS to be visually appealing and is responsive across different devices, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.
Gradual Transitions and Visibility Effects: The output card with the weather data becomes visible with smooth transitions, adding a layer of sophistication to the user interface.
